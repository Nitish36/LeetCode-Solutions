Table: borrowing_records

| record_id     | int     |

| borrower_name | varchar |
| borrow_date   | date    |
| return_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
record_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a borrowing transaction and return_date is NULL if the book is currently borrowed and hasn't been returned yet.
Write a solution to find all books that are currently borrowed (not returned) and have zero copies available in the library.

A book is considered currently borrowed if there exists a borrowing record with a NULL return_date
Return the result table ordered by current borrowers in descending order, then by book title in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
